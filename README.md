### Caveat Emptor!

This is a research repository.

If you're interested in using Dnnamo as a tool, you'll probably have to wait until a full release. I expect this to be sometime in late March 2018, but there's no guarantees in research.

If you're a researcher, then you probably want to wait for the paper, around the same time. It will probably go up on arXiv, and I'm happy to talk more then.

If you're interested in contributing, then it's probably most helpful to send me email at [rdadolf@gmail.com](mailto:rdadolf@gmail.com). You could also submit pull requests, but honestly, the interfaces are changing so quickly that it's likely to take more work to fix things than it's worth (for both of us).
